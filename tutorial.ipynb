    "\n",
    "\"(...)a process where the complete set of metabolic reactions and pathways in a microorganism, tissue, or organism are reconstructed and represented in a computational model based on its genomic data. This model provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the organism's metabolic network and can be used to simulate its behavior under various conditions.\"\n",
