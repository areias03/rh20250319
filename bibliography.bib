MOMENT is shown to significantly improve the prediction accuracy of various metabolic phenotypes in E. coli, including intracellular flux rates and changes in gene expression levels under different growth rates. Most importantly, MOMENT is shown to predict growth rates of E. coli under a diverse set of media that are correlated with experimental measurements, markedly improving upon existing state-of-the art stoichiometric modeling approaches.

The RAVEN Toolbox workflow was applied in order to reconstruct a genome-scale metabolic model for the important microbial cell factory Penicillium chrysogenum Wisconsin54-1255. The model was validated in a bibliomic study of in total 440 references, and it comprises 1471 unique biochemical reactions and 1006 ORFs.

  abstract = {The metabolic capabilities of the species and the local environment shape the microbial interactions in a community either through the exchange of metabolic products or the competition for the resources. Cells are often arranged in close proximity to each other, creating a crowded environment that unevenly reduce the diffusion of nutrients. Herein, we investigated how the crowding conditions and metabolic variability among cells shape the dynamics of microbial communities. For this, we developed CROMICS, a spatio-temporal framework that combines techniques such as individual-based modeling, scaled particle theory, and thermodynamic flux analysis to explicitly incorporate the cell metabolism and the impact of the presence of macromolecular components on the nutrients diffusion. This framework was used to study two archetypical microbial communities (i) Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica that cooperate with each other by exchanging metabolites, and (ii) two E. coli with different production level of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that compete for the same nutrients. In the mutualistic community, our results demonstrate that crowding enhanced the fitness of cooperative mutants by reducing the leakage of metabolites from the region where they are produced, avoiding the resource competition with non-cooperative cells. Moreover, we also show that E. coli EPS-secreting mutants won the competition against the non-secreting cells by creating less dense structures (i.e. increasing the spacing among the cells) that allow mutants to expand and reach regions closer to the nutrient supply point. A modest enhancement of the relative fitness of EPS-secreting cells over the non-secreting ones were found when the crowding effect was taken into account in the simulations. The emergence of cell-cell interactions and the intracellular conflicts arising from the trade-off between growth and the secretion of metabolites or EPS could provide a local competitive advantage to one species, either by supplying more cross-feeding metabolites or by creating a less dense neighborhood.},

However, the coverage of turnover numbers for Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a model eukaryotic microalga accessible to metabolic engineering, is 17-fold smaller compared to the heterotrophic cell factory Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we generate quantitative protein abundance data of Chlamydomonas covering 2337 to 3708 proteins in various growth conditions to estimate in vivo maximum apparent turnover numbers. Using constrained-based modeling we provide proxies for in vivo turnover numbers of 568 reactions, representing a 10-fold increase over the in vitro data for Chlamydomonas. Integration of the in vivo estimates instead of in vitro values in a metabolic model of Chlamydomonas improved the accuracy of enzyme usage predictions. Our results help in extending the knowledge on uncharacterized enzymes and improve biotechnological applications of Chlamydomonas.},

  abstract = {The gut microbiome is shaped by diet and influences host metabolism; however, these links are complex and can be unique to each individual. We performed deep metagenomic sequencing of 1,203 gut microbiomes from 1,098 individuals enrolled in the Personalised Responses to Dietary Composition Trial (PREDICT 1) study, whose detailed long-term diet information, as well as hundreds of fasting and same-meal postprandial cardiometabolic blood marker measurements were available. We found many significant associations between microbes and specific nutrients, foods, food groups and general dietary indices, which were driven especially by the presence and diversity of healthy and plant-based foods. Microbial biomarkers of obesity were reproducible across external publicly available cohorts and in agreement with circulating blood metabolites that are indicators of cardiovascular disease risk. While some microbes, such as Prevotella copri and Blastocystis spp., were indicators of favorable postprandial glucose metabolism, overall microbiome composition was predictive for a large panel of cardiometabolic blood markers including fasting and postprandial glycemic, lipemic and inflammatory indices. The panel of intestinal species associated with healthy dietary habits overlapped with those associated with favorable cardiometabolic and postprandial markers, indicating that our large-scale resource can potentially stratify the gut microbiome into generalizable health levels in individuals without clinically manifest disease.},

  abstract = {In the post-genomic era, Genome-scale metabolic networks (GEMs) have emerged as invaluable tools to understand metabolic capabilities of organisms. Different parts of these metabolic networks are defined as subsystems/pathways, which are sets of functional roles to implement a specific biological process or structural complex, such as glycolysis and TCA cycle. Subsystem/pathway definition is also employed to delineate the biosynthetic routes that produce biomass building blocks. In databases, such as MetaCyc and SEED, these representations are composed of linear routes from precursors to target biomass building blocks. However, this approach cannot capture the nested, complex nature of GEMs. Here we implemented an algorithm, lumpGEM, which generates biosynthetic subnetworks composed of reactions that can synthesize a target metabolite from a set of defined core precursor metabolites. lumpGEM captures balanced subnetworks, which account for the fate of all metabolites along the synthesis routes, thus encapsulating reactions from various subsystems/pathways to balance these metabolites in the metabolic network. Moreover, lumpGEM collapses these subnetworks into elementally balanced lumped reactions that specify the cost of all precursor metabolites and cofactors. It also generates alternative subnetworks and lumped reactions for the same metabolite, accounting for the flexibility of organisms. lumpGEM is applicable to any GEM and any target metabolite defined in the network. Lumped reactions generated by lumpGEM can be also used to generate properly balanced reduced core metabolic models.},

However the complexity of these large metabolic networks often hinders their utility in various practical applications. Although reduced models are commonly used for modeling and in integrating experimental data, they are often inconsistent across different studies and laboratories due to different criteria and detail, which can compromise transferability of the findings and also integration of experimental data from different groups. In this study, we have developed a systematic semi-automatic approach to reduce genome-scale models into core models in a consistent and logical manner focusing on the central metabolism or subsystems of interest. The method minimizes the loss of information using an approach that combines graph-based search and optimization methods. The resulting core models are shown to be able to capture key properties of the genome-scale models and preserve consistency in terms of biomass and by-product yields, flux and concentration variability and gene essentiality. The development of these ``consistently-reduced'' models will help to clarify and facilitate integration of different experimental data to draw new understanding that can be directly extendable to genome-scale models.},

  abstract = {Metabolic activities of the microbial population are important to maintain the balance of almost all the ecosystems on earth. In the human gut environment, these microbial communities play essential roles in digestion and help to maintain biochemical homeostasis by synthesizing several vital metabolic compounds. Imbalance in the microbial abundance and community structure in the human gut microbiota leads to different diseases and metabolic disorders. Studying the metabolic interplay between the microbial consortia within the host environment is the key to exploring the cause behind the development of various diseases condition. However, mapping the entire biochemical characteristic of human gut microbiota may not be feasible only through experimental approaches. Therefore, the advanced systems biology approach, i.e., metagenome-scale community metabolic modelling, is introduced for understanding the metabolic role and interaction pattern of the entire microbiome. This in silico method directly uses the metagenomic information to model the microbial communities, which mimic the metabolic behavior of the human gut microbiome. This review discusses the recent development of metagenome-scale community metabolic model reconstruction tools and their application in studying the inter-link between the human gut microbiome and health. The application of the community metabolic models to study the metabolic profile of the human gut microbiome has also been investigated. Alteration of the metabolic fluxes associated with different biochemical activities in type 1 diabetics, type 2 diabetics, inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), gouty arthritis, colorectal cancer (CRC), etc., has also been assessed with the metagenome-scale models. Thus, modelling the microbial communities combined with advanced experimental design may lead to novel therapeutic approaches like personalized microbiome modelling for treating human disease.},

  abstract = {Microbial communities often undergo intricate compositional changes yet also maintain stable coexistence of diverse species. The mechanisms underlying long-term coexistence remain unclear as system-wide studies have been largely limited to engineered communities, ex situ adapted cultures or synthetic assemblies. Here, we show how kefir, a natural milk-fermenting community of prokaryotes (predominantly lactic and acetic acid bacteria) and yeasts (family Saccharomycetaceae), realizes stable coexistence through spatiotemporal orchestration of species and metabolite dynamics. During milk fermentation, kefir grains (a polysaccharide matrix synthesized by kefir microorganisms) grow in mass but remain unchanged in composition. In contrast, the milk is colonized in a sequential manner in which early members open the niche for the followers by making available metabolites such as amino acids and lactate. Through metabolomics, transcriptomics and large-scale mapping of inter-species interactions, we show how microorganisms poorly suited for milk survive in---and even dominate---the community, through metabolic cooperation and uneven partitioning between grain and milk. Overall, our findings reveal how inter-species interactions partitioned in space and time lead to stable coexistence.},

  abstract = {Constraint-based genome-scale models (GEMs) of microorganisms provide a powerful tool for predicting and analyzing microbial phenotypes as well as for understanding how these are affected by genetic and environmental perturbations. Recently, MATLAB and Python-based tools have been developed to incorporate enzymatic constraints into GEMs. These constraints enhance phenotype predictions by accounting for the enzyme cost of catalyzed model{\textasciiacute}s reactions, thereby reducing the space of possible metabolic flux distributions. In this study, enzymatic constraints were added to an existing GEM of Clostridium ljungdahlii, a model acetogenic bacterium, by including its enzyme turnover numbers (kcats) and molecular masses, using the Python-based AutoPACMEN approach. When compared to the metabolic model iHN637, the enzyme cost-constrained model (ec\_iHN637) obtained in our study showed an improved predictive ability of growth rate and product profile. The model ec\_iHN637 was then employed to perform in silico metabolic engineering of C. ljungdahlii, by using the OptKnock computational framework to identify knockouts to enhance the production of desired fermentation products. The in silico metabolic engineering was geared towards increasing the production of fermentation products by C. ljungdahlii, with a focus on the utilization of synthesis gas and CO2. This resulted in different engineering strategies for overproduction of valuable metabolites under different feeding conditions, without redundant knockouts for different products. Importantly, the results of the in silico engineering results indicated that the mixotrophic growth of C. ljungdahlii is a promising approach to coupling improved cell growth and acetate and ethanol productivity with net CO2 fixation.},

  abstract = {Building models is essential for understanding the functions and dynamics of microbial communities. Metabolic models built on genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions (GENREs) are especially relevant as a means to decipher the complex interactions occurring among species. Model reconstruction increasingly relies on metagenomics, which permits direct characterisation of naturally occurring communities that may contain organisms that cannot be isolated or cultured. In this review, we provide an overview of the field of metabolic modelling and its increasing reliance on and synergy with metagenomics and bioinformatics. We survey the means of assigning functions and reconstructing metabolic networks from (meta-)genomes, and present the variety and mathematical fundamentals of metabolic models that foster the understanding of microbial dynamics. We emphasise the characterisation of interactions and the scaling of model construction to large communities, two important bottlenecks in the applicability of these models. We give an overview of the current state of the art in metagenome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis, focusing on the reconstruction of genomes in microbial communities. Metagenomics benefits tremendously from third-generation sequencing, and we discuss the opportunities of long-read sequencing, strain-level characterisation and eukaryotic metagenomics. We aim at providing algorithmic and mathematical support, together with tool and application resources, that permit bridging the gap between metagenomics and metabolic modelling.},

  abstract = {Genome-scale metabolic modeling has become widespread for analyzing microbial metabolism. Extending this established paradigm to more complex microbial communities is emerging as a promising way to unravel the interactions and biochemical repertoire of these omnipresent systems. While several modeling techniques have been developed for microbial communities, little emphasis has been placed on the need to impose a time-averaged constant growth rate across all members for a community to ensure co-existence and stability. In the absence of this constraint, the faster growing organism will ultimately displace all other microbes in the community. This is particularly important for predicting steady-state microbiota composition as it imposes significant restrictions on the allowable community membership, composition and phenotypes. In this study, we introduce the SteadyCom optimization framework for predicting metabolic flux distributions consistent with the steady-state requirement. SteadyCom can be rapidly converged by iteratively solving linear programming (LP) problem and the number of iterations is independent of the number of organisms. A significant advantage of SteadyCom is compatibility with flux variability analysis. SteadyCom is first demonstrated for a community of four E. coli double auxotrophic mutants and is then applied to a gut microbiota model consisting of nine species, with representatives from the phyla Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. In contrast to the direct use of FBA, SteadyCom is able to predict the change in species abundance in response to changes in diets with minimal additional imposed constraints on the model. By randomizing the uptake rates of microbes, an abundance profile with a good agreement to experimental gut microbiota is inferred. SteadyCom provides an important step towards the cross-cutting task of predicting the composition of a microbial community in a given environment.},

GECKO has enabled reconstruction of enzyme-constrained metabolic models (ecModels) for diverse organisms, which show better predictive performance than conventional GEMs. In this protocol, we describe how to use the latest version GECKO 3.0; the procedure has five stages: (1) expansion from a starting metabolic model to an ecModel structure, (2) integration of enzyme turnover numbers into the ecModel structure, (3) model tuning, (4) integration of proteomics data into the ecModel and (5) simulation and analysis of ecModels. GECKO 3.0 incorporates deep learning-predicted enzyme kinetics, paving the way for improved metabolic models for virtually any organism and cell line in the absence of experimental data.

Herein, we utilize metagenomics and genome-scale metabolic models (GSMMs) to investigate the microbial composition, metabolic functions in PM microbiota, as well as to identify microorganisms and communities linked to flavor compounds. Metagenomic data revealed that the most prevalent assembly of bacteria and archaea was Proteiniphilum, Caproicibacterium, Petrimonas, Lactobacillus, Clostridium, Aminobacterium, Syntrophomonas, Methanobacterium, Methanoculleus, and Methanosarcina. The important enzymes of PM were in both GH and GT family metabolism. A total of 38 highquality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were obtained, including those at the family level (n = 13), genus level (n = 17), and species level (n = 8). GSMMs of the 38 MAGs were then constructed. From the GSMMs, individual and community capabilities respectively were predicted to be able to produce 111 metabolites and 598 metabolites. Twenty-three predicted metabolites were consistent with the metabonomics detected flavors and served as targets. Twelve sub-community of were screened by cross-feeding of 38 GSMMs. Of them, Methanobacterium, Sphaerochaeta, Muricomes intestini, Methanobacteriaceae, Synergistaceae, and Caloramator were core microorganisms for targets in each sub-community. Overall, this study of metagenomic and target-community screening could help our understanding of the metabolite--microbiome association and further bioregulation of baijiu.},

Here, by harnessing the long read advantage provided by Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT), we characterize fine-scale genetic variations of structural variations (SVs) in hundreds of gut microbiomes from healthy humans. ONT long reads dramatically improve the quality of metagenomic assemblies, enable reliable detection of a large, expanded set of structural variation types (notably including large insertions and inversions). We find SVs are highly distinct between individuals and stable within an individual, representing gut microbiome fingerprints that shape strain-level differentiations in function within species, complicating the associations to metabolites and host phenotypes such as blood glucose. In summary, our study strongly emphasizes that incorporating ONT reads into metagenomic analyses expands the detection scope of genetic variations, enables profiling strain-level variations in gut microbiome, and their intricate correlations with metabolome.},

Our data-driven model quantifies microbial interactions impacting growth and butyrate production separately, providing key insights into ecological mechanisms driving butyrate production. We use our model to explore a vast community design space using a design-test-learn cycle to identify high butyrate-producing communities. Our model can accurately predict community assembly and butyrate production across a wide range of species richness. Guided by the model, we identify constraints on butyrate production by high species richness and key molecular factors driving butyrate production, including hydrogen sulfide, environmental pH, and resource competition. In sum, our model-guided approach provides a flexible and generalizable framework for understanding and accurately predicting community assembly and metabolic functions.},

The neural network combines recurrent memory cells and convolutional layers, adapting the information gained from both the high-throughput ribosome profiling data and ribosome binding translation initiation sequence region into one model. DeepRibo is designed as a single model trained on a variety of ribosome profiling experiments, used for the identification of open reading frames in prokaryotes without a priori knowledge of the translational landscape.

However, despite increasing efforts in metagenomic sequencing of various habitats1--3, little is known about the distribution of genes across the global biosphere, with implications for human and planetary health. Here we constructed a non-redundant gene catalogue of 303 million species-level genes (clustered at 95\% nucleotide identity) from 13,174 publicly available metagenomes across 14 major habitats and use it to show that most genes are specific to a single habitat. The small fraction of genes found in multiple habitats is enriched in antibiotic-resistance genes and markers for mobile genetic elements. By further clustering these species-level genes into 32 million protein families, we observed that a small fraction of these families contain the majority of the genes (0.6\% of families account for 50\% of the genes). The majority of species-level genes and protein families are rare. Furthermore, species-level genes, and in particular the rare ones, show low rates of positive (adaptive) selection, supporting a model in which most genetic variability observed within each protein family is neutral or nearly neutral.},

This stability is considered critical for good health but is poorly understood. Here we develop a body of ecological theory to help us understand microbiome stability. Although cooperating networks of microbes can be efficient, we find that they are often unstable. Counterintuitively, this finding indicates that hosts can benefit from microbial competition when this competition dampens cooperative networks and increases stability. More generally, stability is promoted by limiting positive feedbacks and weakening ecological interactions. We have analyzed host mechanisms for maintaining stability---including immune suppression, spatial structuring, and feeding of community members---and support our key predictions with recent data.},

  abstract = {Horizontal gene transfer, the exchange of genetic material through means other than reproduction, is a fundamental force in prokaryotic genome evolution. Genomic persistence of horizontally transferred genes has been shown to be influenced by both ecological and evolutionary factors. However, there is limited availability of ecological information about species other than the habitats from which they were isolated, which has prevented a deeper exploration of ecological contributions to horizontal gene transfer. Here we focus on transfers detected through comparison of individual gene trees to the species tree, assessing the distribution of gene-exchanging prokaryotes across over a million environmental sequencing samples. By analysing detected horizontal gene transfer events, we show distinct functional profiles for recent versus old events. Although most genes transferred are part of the accessory genome, genes transferred earlier in evolution tend to be more ubiquitous within present-day species. We find that co-occurring, interacting and high-abundance species tend to exchange more genes. Finally, we show that host-associated specialist species are most likely to exchange genes with other host-associated specialist species, whereas species found across different habitats have similar gene exchange rates irrespective of their preferred habitat. Our study covers an unprecedented scale of integrated horizontal gene transfer and environmental information, highlighting broad eco-evolutionary trends.},

Streamlined integration of enzyme constraints and proteomics data into such models was first enabled by the GECKO toolbox, allowing the study of phenotypes constrained by protein limitations. Here, we upgrade the toolbox in order to enhance models with enzyme and proteomics constraints for any organism with a compatible GEM reconstruction. With this, enzyme-constrained models for the budding yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Yarrowia lipolytica and Kluyveromyces marxianus are generated to study their long-term adaptation to several stress factors by incorporation of proteomics data. Predictions reveal that upregulation and high saturation of enzymes in amino acid metabolism are common across organisms and conditions, suggesting the relevance of metabolic robustness in contrast to optimal protein utilization as a cellular objective for microbial growth under stress and nutrient-limited conditions. The functionality of GECKO is expanded with an automated framework for continuous and version-controlled update of enzyme-constrained GEMs, also producing such models for Escherichia coli and Homo sapiens. In this work, we facilitate the utilization of enzyme-constrained GEMs in basic science, metabolic engineering and synthetic biology purposes.},

We illustrate our hybrid models with growth rate predictions of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida grown in different media and with phenotype predictions of gene knocked-out Escherichia coli mutants. Our neural-mechanistic models systematically outperform constraint-based models and require training set sizes orders of magnitude smaller than classical machine learning methods. Our hybrid approach opens a doorway to enhancing constraint-based modeling: instead of constraining mechanistic models with additional experimental measurements, our hybrid models grasp the power of machine learning while fulfilling mechanistic constrains, thus saving time and resources in typical systems biology or biological engineering projects.},

Here, through integrated multi-omics analyses of 2,173 European residents from the MetaCardis cohort, we show that the explanatory power of drugs for the variability in both host and gut microbiome features exceeds that of disease. We quantify inferred effects of single medications, their combinations as well as additive effects,~and show that the latter shift the metabolome and microbiome towards a healthier state, exemplified in synergistic reduction in serum atherogenic lipoproteins by statins combined with aspirin, or enrichment of intestinal Roseburia by diuretic~agents combined with beta-blockers. Several antibiotics exhibit a quantitative relationship between the number of courses prescribed and progression towards a microbiome state that is associated with the severity of cardiometabolic disease. We also report a relationship between cardiometabolic drug dosage, improvement in clinical markers and microbiome composition, supporting direct drug effects. Taken together, our computational framework and resulting resources enable the disentanglement of the effects of drugs and disease on host and microbiome features in multimedicated individuals. Furthermore, the robust signatures identified using our framework provide new hypotheses for drug--host--microbiome interactions in cardiometabolic disease.},

Recent advances in genome annotation and systems biology now allow us to semiautomatically reconstruct genome-scale metabolic models (GSMMs) of microorganisms based on their genome sequence 1 . Next, growth of these models in a defined metabolic environment can be predicted in silico, mechanistically linking the metabolic fluxes of individual microbial populations to the community dynamics. A major advantage of GSMMs is that no training data is needed, besides information about the metabolic capacity of individual genes (genome annotation) and knowledge of the available environmental metabolites that allow the microorganism to grow. However, the composition of the environment is often not fully determined and remains difficult to measure 2 . We hypothesized that the relative abundance of different bacterial species, as measured by metagenomics, can be combined with GSMMs of individual bacteria to reveal the metabolic status of a given biome. Using a newly developed algorithm involving over 1,500 GSMMs of human-associated bacteria, we inferred distinct metabolomes for four human body sites that are consistent with experimental data. Together, we link the metagenome to the metabolome in a mechanistic framework towards predictive microbiome modelling.},

A primary challenge in cell physiology is to identify which of these molecular-level changes are active regulatory events. Here, we introduce pseudo-transition analysis, an approach that uses multiple steady-state observations of 13C-resolved fluxes, metabolites, and transcripts to infer which regulatory events drive metabolic adaptations following environmental transitions. Pseudo-transition analysis recapitulates known biology and identifies an unexpectedly sparse, transition-dependent regulatory landscape: typically a handful of regulatory events drive adaptation between carbon sources, with transcription mainly regulating TCA cycle flux and reactants regulating EMP pathway flux. We verify these observations using time-resolved measurements of the diauxic shift, demonstrating that some dynamic transitions can be approximated as monotonic shifts between steady-state extremes. Overall, we show that pseudo-transition analysis can explore the vast regulatory landscape of dynamic transitions using relatively few steady-state data, thereby guiding time-consuming, hypothesis-driven molecular validations.},

First, we discuss the latest advances in in silico modeling of the microbiota-nutrition-health axis, including the application of statistical, mechanistic, and hybrid artificial intelligence models. Second, we address high-throughput in vitro techniques for assessing interindividual heterogeneity, from ex vivo batch culturing of stool and continuous culturing in anaerobic bioreactors, to more sophisticated organ-on-a-chip models that integrate both host and microbial compartments. Third, we explore in vivo approaches for better understanding of personalized, microbiota-mediated responses to diet, prebiotics, and probiotics, from nonhuman animal models and human observational studies, to human feeding trials and crossover interventions. We highlight examples of existing, consumer-facing precision nutrition platforms that are currently leveraging the gut microbiota. Furthermore, we discuss how the integration of a broader set of the tools and techniques described in this piece can generate the data necessary to support a greater diversity of precision nutrition strategies. Finally, we present a vision of a precision nutrition and healthcare future, which leverages the gut microbiota to design effective, individual-specific interventions.},

Combining the theory of skew-product dynamical systems with topological data analysis, we show that simultaneous recurrence events across multiple time series reveal the structure of their shared unobserved driving signal. We introduce a physics-based unsupervised learning algorithm that reconstructs causal drivers by iteratively building a recurrence graph with glasslike structure. As the amount of data increases, a percolation transition on this graph leads to weak ergodicity breaking for random walks---revealing the shared driver's dynamics, even from strongly corrupted measurements. We relate reconstruction accuracy to the rate of information transfer from a chaotic driver to the response systems, and we find that effective reconstruction proceeds through gradual approximation of the driver's dynamical attractor. Through extensive benchmarks against classical signal processing and machine learning techniques, we demonstrate our method's ability to extract causal drivers from diverse experimental datasets spanning ecology, genomics, fluid dynamics, and physiology.},

Bridging theory and experiment is hampered by the multiplicity of ecological processes that simultaneously affect community assembly in natural ecosystems. We addressed this challenge by monitoring the assembly of hundreds of soil- and plant-derived microbiomes in well-controlled minimal synthetic media. Both the community-level function and the coarse-grained taxonomy of the resulting communities are highly predictable and governed by nutrient availability, despite substantial species variability. By generalizing classical ecological models to include widespread nonspecific cross-feeding, we show that these features are all emergent properties of the assembly of large microbial communities, explaining their ubiquity in natural microbiomes.},

The species composition and overall function of microbial communities are largely shaped by metabolic interactions such as competition for resources and cross-feeding. Although considerable scientific progress has been made towards mapping and modelling species-level metabolism, elucidating the metabolic exchanges between microorganisms and steering the community dynamics remain an enormous scientific challenge. In view of the complexity, computational models of microbial communities are essential to obtain systems-level understanding of ecosystem functioning. This review discusses the applications and limitations of constraint-based stoichiometric modelling tools, and in particular flux balance analysis (FBA). We explain this approach from first principles and identify the challenges one faces when extending it to communities, and discuss the approaches used in the field in view of these challenges. We distinguish between steady-state and dynamic FBA approaches extended to communities. We conclude that much progress has been made, but many of the challenges are still open.},

  abstract = {Gut microbes comprise a high density, biologically active community that lies at the interface of an animal with its nutritional environment. Consequently their activity profoundly influences many aspects of the physiology and metabolism of the host animal. A range of microbial structural components and metabolites directly interact with host intestinal cells and tissues to influence nutrient uptake and epithelial health. Endocrine, neuronal and lymphoid cells in the gut also integrate signals from these microbial factors to influence systemic responses. Dysregulation of these host-microbe interactions is now recognised as a major risk factor in the development of metabolic dysfunction. This is a two-way process and understanding the factors that tip host-microbiome homeostasis over to dysbiosis requires greater appreciation of the host feedbacks that contribute to regulation of microbial community composition. To date, numerous studies have employed taxonomic profiling approaches to explore the links between microbial composition and host outcomes (especially obesity and its comorbidities), but inconsistent host-microbe associations have been reported. Available data indicates multiple factors have contributed to discrepancies between studies. These include the high level of functional redundancy in host-microbiome interactions combined with individual variation in microbiome composition; differences in study design, diet composition and host system between studies; and inherent limitations to the resolution of rRNA-based community profiling. Accounting for these factors allows for recognition of the common microbial and host factors driving community composition and development of dysbiosis on high fat diets. New therapeutic intervention options are now emerging.},

Based on the fact that the occurrence of a metabolic reaction generally requires the existence of other reactions providing its substrates, series of metabolic networks are constructed. In each step of the corresponding expansion process those reactions are incorporated whose substrates are made available by the networks of the previous generations. The method is applied to the set of all metabolic reactions included in the KEGG database. Starting with one or more seed compounds, the expansion results in a final network whose compounds define the scope of the seed. Scopes of all metabolic compounds are calculated and it is shown that large parts of cellular metabolism can be considered as the combined scope of simple building blocks. Analyses of various expansion processes reveal crucial metabolites whose incorporation allows for the increase in network complexity. Among these metabolites are common cofactors such as NAD+, ATP, and coenzyme A. We demonstrate that the outcome of network expansion is in general very robust against elimination of single or few reactions. There exist, however, crucial reactions whose elimination results in a dramatic reduction of scope sizes. It is hypothesized that the expansion process displays characteristics of the evolution of metabolism such as the temporal order of the emergence of metabolic pathways.},

Here we apply a model-based approach to integrate such experimental data and thereby infer metabolic-exchange fluxes. We designed a synthetic anaerobic co-culture of Clostridium acetobutylicum and Wolinella succinogenes that interact via interspecies hydrogen transfer and applied different environmental conditions for which we expected the metabolic-exchange rates to change. We used stoichiometric models of the metabolism of the two microorganisms that represents our current physiological understanding and found that this understanding - the model - is sufficient to infer the identity and magnitude of the metabolic-exchange fluxes and it suggested unexpected interactions. Where the model could not fit all experimental data, it indicates specific requirement for further physiological studies. We show that the nitrogen source influences the rate of interspecies hydrogen transfer in the co-culture. Additionally, the model can predict the intracellular fluxes and optimal metabolic exchange rates, which can point to engineering strategies. This study therefore offers a realistic illustration of the strengths and weaknesses of model-based integration of heterogenous data that makes inference of metabolic-exchange fluxes possible from community-level experimental data.},

First, we predicted and experimentally confirmed the species ratio to which a two-species mutualistic consortium converges and the equilibrium composition of a newly engineered three-member community. We next identified a specific spatial arrangement of colonies, which gives rise to what we term the "eclipse dilemma": does a competitor placed between a colony and its cross-feeding partner benefit or hurt growth of the original colony? Our experimentally validated finding that the net outcome is beneficial highlights the complex nature of metabolic interactions in microbial communities while at the same time demonstrating their predictability.},

  abstract = {The human microbiome influences the efficacy and safety of a wide variety of commonly prescribed drugs. Designing precision medicine approaches that incorporate microbial metabolism would require strain- and molecule-resolved, scalable computational modeling. Here, we extend our previous resource of genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of human gut microorganisms with a greatly expanded version. AGORA2 (assembly of gut organisms through reconstruction and analysis, version 2) accounts for 7,302 strains, includes strain-resolved drug degradation and biotransformation capabilities for 98 drugs, and was extensively curated based on comparative genomics and literature searches. The microbial reconstructions performed very well against three independently assembled experimental datasets with an accuracy of 0.72 to 0.84, surpassing other reconstruction resources and predicted known microbial drug transformations with an accuracy of 0.81. We demonstrate that AGORA2 enables personalized, strain-resolved modeling by predicting the drug conversion potential of the gut microbiomes from 616 patients with colorectal cancer and controls, which greatly varied between individuals and correlated with age, sex, body mass index and disease stages. AGORA2 serves as a knowledge base for the human microbiome and paves the way to personalized, predictive analysis of host--microbiome metabolic interactions.},

  abstract = {Background The role of methane in global warming has become paramount to the environment and the human society, especially in the past few decades. Methane cycling microbial communities play an important role in the global methane cycle, which is why the characterization of these communities is critical to understand and manipulate their behavior. Methanotrophs are a major player in these communities and are able to oxidize methane as their primary carbon source. Results Lake Washington is a freshwater lake characterized by a methane-oxygen countergradient that contains a methane cycling microbial community. Methanotrophs are a major part of this community involved in assimilating methane from lake water. Two significant methanotrophic species in this community are Methylobacter and Methylomonas. In this work, these methanotrophs are computationally studied via developing highly curated genome-scale metabolic models. Each model was then integrated to form a community model with a multi-level optimization framework. The competitive and mutualistic metabolic interactions among Methylobacter and Methylomonas were also characterized. The community model was next tested under carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen limited conditions in addition to a nutrient-rich condition to observe the systematic shifts in the internal metabolic pathways and extracellular metabolite exchanges. Each condition showed variations in the methane oxidation pathway, pyruvate metabolism, and the TCA cycle as well as the excretion of formaldehyde and carbon di-oxide in the community. Finally, the community model was simulated under fixed ratios of these two members to reflect the opposing behavior in the two-member synthetic community and in sediment-incubated communities. The community simulations predicted a noticeable switch in intracellular carbon metabolism and formaldehyde transfer between community members in sediment-incubated vs. synthetic condition. Conclusion In this work, we attempted to predict the response of a simplified methane cycling microbial community from Lake Washington to varying environments and also provide an insight into the difference of dynamics in sediment-incubated microcosm community and synthetic co-cultures. Overall, this study lays the ground for in silico systems-level studies of freshwater lake ecosystems, which can drive future efforts of understanding, engineering, and modifying these communities for dealing with global warming issues.},

  abstract = {Background:  Myceliophthora thermophila has been engineered to be an important cell factory for malic acid production, however detail information on how carbon fluxes are distributed in the high production strain is still not clear. 13 C-MFA ( 13 C metabolic flux analysis) can help to understand cellular metabolic mechanisms and identify important targets for deciphering the carbon flux distribution and improving product synthesis. Here, we used 13 C-MFA to study metabolic flux distribution of high malate production strain of M. thermophile for the first time. Results  Higher glucose uptake and carbon dioxide release rate, together with lower oxygen consumption rate and biomass yield was found in malate high production strain M. thermophila JG207 compared to the wild strain. Corresponding to the above phenotypes, it is found that in JG207 both pentose phosphate pathway flux and oxidative phosphorylation flux decreased, while TCA downstream flux increased. Higher PPP flux in WT strain accompanied with higher energy state, and corresponding high ATP concentration inhibited glucose-6-phosphate isomerase activity. Several intermediates of reduced TCA pathway in JG207 were accumulated due to high reduction power state, which benefits the conversion of oxalate to malate. The reduced flux of oxidative phosphorylation is shown to be able to cover extra supply of NADH for high malate production. Conclusions  This work revealed the intracellular metabolic fluxes distribution for the high malic acid production strain M. thermophile JG207 for the first time. The flux distribution results showed that higher NADH supply was of high importance for higher accumulation of malic acids, this may be guidance for further improvement of the productivity.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Illness course plays a crucial role in delineating psychiatric disorders. However, existing nosologies consider only its most basic features (e.g., symptom sequence, duration). We developed a Dynamic Causal Model (DCM) that characterizes course patterns more fully using dense timeseries data. This foundational study introduces the new modeling approach and evaluates its validity using empirical and simulated data. METHODS: A three-level DCM was constructed to model how latent dynamics produce symptoms of depression, mania, and psychosis. This model was fit to symptom scores of nine patients collected prospectively over four years, following first hospitalization. Simulated subjects based on these empirical data were used to evaluate model parameters at the subject-level. At the group-level, we tested the accuracy with which the DCM can estimate the latent course patterns using Parametric Empirical Bayes (PEB) and leave-one-out cross-validation. RESULTS: Analyses of empirical data showed that DCM accurately captured symptom trajectories for all nine subjects. Simulation results showed that parameters could be estimated accurately (correlations between generative and estimated parameters {$>$}= 0.76). Moreover, the model could distinguish different latent course patterns, with PEB correctly assigning simulated patients for eight of nine course patterns. When testing any pair of two specific course patterns using leave-one-out cross-validation, 30 out of 36 pairs showed a moderate or high out-of-samples correlation between the true group-membership and the estimated group-membership values. CONCLUSION: DCM has been widely used in neuroscience to infer latent neuronal processes from neuroimaging data. Our findings highlight the potential of adopting this methodology for modeling symptom trajectories to explicate nosologic entities, temporal patterns that define them, and facilitate personalized treatment.},

Pathway maps are the primary dataset in KEGG representing systemic functions of the cell and the organism in terms of molecular interaction and reaction networks. The KEGG Orthology (KO) system is a mechanism for linking genes and proteins to pathway maps and other molecular networks. Each KO is a generic gene identifier and each pathway map is created as a network of KO nodes. This architecture enables KEGG pathway mapping to uncover systemic features from KO assigned genomes and metagenomes. Additional roles of KOs include characterization of conserved genes and conserved units of genes in organism groups, which can be done by taxonomy mapping. A new tool has been developed for identifying conserved gene orders in chromosomes, in which gene orders are treated as sequences of KOs. Furthermore, a new dataset called VOG (virus ortholog group) is computationally generated from virus proteins and expanded to proteins of cellular organisms, allowing gene orders to be compared as VOG sequences as well. Together with these datasets and analysis tools, new types of pathway maps are being developed to present a global view of biological processes involving multiple organism groups.},

We then use this resource to train a multi-scale model that integrates four omics layers to predict genome-wide concentrations and growth dynamics. The genetic and environmental ontology reconstructed from the omics data is substantially different and complementary to the genetic and chemical ontologies. The integration of different layers confers an incremental increase in the prediction performance, as does the information about the known gene regulatory and protein-protein interactions. The predictive performance of the model ranges from 0.54 to 0.87 for the various omics layers, which far exceeds various baselines.

However, a new era has emerged with the advent of long-read sequencing (LRS), which offers substantial improvements over its predecessor, short-read sequencing (SRS). LRS produces reads that are several kilobases long, enabling researchers to obtain more complete and contiguous genomic information, characterize structural variations, and study epigenetic modifications. The current leaders in LRS technologies are Pacific Biotechnologies (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), each offering a distinct set of advantages. This review covers the workflow of long-read metagenomics sequencing, including sample preparation (sample collection, sample extraction, and library preparation), sequencing, processing (quality control, assembly, and binning), and analysis (taxonomic annotation and functional annotation). Each section provides a concise outline of the key concept of the methodology, presenting the original concept as well as how it is challenged or modified in the context of LRS. Additionally, the section introduces a range of tools that are compatible with LRS and can be utilized to execute the LRS process. This review aims to present the workflow of metagenomics, highlight the transformative impact of LRS, and provide researchers with a selection of tools suitable for this task.},

  abstract = {Constraint-based modeling (CBM) has evolved as the core systems biology tool to map the interrelations between genotype, phenotype, and external environment. The recent advancement of high-throughput experimental approaches and multi-omics strategies has generated a plethora of new and precise information from wideranging biological domains. On the other hand, the continuously growing field of machine learning (ML) and its specialized branch of deep learning (DL) provide essential computational architectures for decoding complex and heterogeneous biological data. In recent years, both multi-omics and ML have assisted in the escalation of CBM. Condition-specific omics data, such as transcriptomics and proteomics, helped contextualize the model prediction while analyzing a particular phenotypic signature. At the same time, the advanced ML tools have eased the model reconstruction and analysis to increase the accuracy and prediction power. However, the development of these multi-disciplinary methodological frameworks mainly occurs independently, which limits the concatenation of biological knowledge from different domains. Hence, we have reviewed the potential of integrating multi-disciplinary tools and strategies from various fields, such as synthetic biology, CBM, omics, and ML, to explore the biochemical phenomenon beyond the conventional biological dogma. How the integrative knowledge of these intersected domains has improved bioengineering and biomedical applications has also been highlighted. We categorically explained the conventional genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) reconstruction tools and their improvement strategies through ML paradigms. Further, the crucial role of ML and DL in omics data restructuring for GEM development has also been briefly discussed. Finally, the case-study-based assessment of the state-of-the-art method for improving biomedical and metabolic engineering strategies has been elaborated. Therefore, this review demonstrates how integrating experimental and in silico strategies can help map the ever-expanding knowledge of biological systems driven by condition-specific cellular information. This multiview approach will elevate the application of ML-based CBM in the biomedical and bioengineering fields for the betterment of society and the environment.},

  abstract = {The human microbiome plays a key role in human health and is associated with numerous diseases. Metagenomic-based studies are now generating valuable information about the composition of the microbiome in health and in disease, demonstrating nonneutral assembly processes and complex co-occurrence patterns. However, the underlying ecological forces that structure the microbiome are still unclear. Specifically, compositional studies alone with no information about mechanisms of interaction, potential competition, or syntrophy, cannot clearly distinguish habitat-filtering and species assortment assembly processes. To address this challenge, we introduce a computational framework, integrating metagenomic-based compositional data with genome-scale metabolic modeling of species interaction. We use in silico metabolic network models to predict levels of competition and complementarity among 154 microbiome species and compare predicted interaction measures to species co-occurrence. Applying this approach to two large-scale datasets describing the composition of the gut microbiome, we find that species tend to co-occur across individuals more frequently with species with which they strongly compete, suggesting that microbiome assembly is dominated by habitat filtering. Moreover, species' partners and excluders exhibit distinct metabolic interaction levels. Importantly, we show that these trends cannot be explained by phylogeny alone and hold across multiple taxonomic levels. Interestingly, controlling for host health does not change the observed patterns, indicating that the axes along which species are filtered are not fully defined by macroecological host states. The approach presented here lays the foundation for a reverse-ecology framework for addressing key questions concerning the assembly of host-associated communities and for informing clinical efforts to manipulate the microbiome.},

Personalized prediction of tumor radiosensitivity is not currently implemented clinically due to insufficient accuracy of existing machine learning classifiers. Despite the acknowledged role of tumor metabolism in radiation response, metabolomics data is rarely collected in large multi-omics initiatives such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and consequently omitted from algorithm development. In this study, we circumvent the paucity of personalized metabolomics information by characterizing 915 TCGA patient tumors with genome-scale metabolic Flux Balance Analysis models generated from transcriptomic and genomic datasets. Metabolic biomarkers differentiating radiation-sensitive and -resistant tumors are predicted and experimentally validated, enabling integration of metabolic features with other multi-omics datasets into ensemble-based machine learning classifiers for radiation response. These multi-omics classifiers show improved classification accuracy, identify clinical patient subgroups, and demonstrate the utility of personalized blood-based metabolic biomarkers for radiation sensitivity. The integration of machine learning with genome-scale metabolic modeling represents a significant methodological advancement for identifying prognostic metabolite biomarkers and predicting radiosensitivity for individual patients.},

  abstract = {The molecular basis of how temperature affects cell metabolism has been a long-standing question in biology, where the main obstacles are the lack of high-quality data and methods to associate temperature effects on the function of individual proteins as well as to combine them at a systems level. Here we develop and apply a Bayesian modeling approach to resolve the temperature effects in genome scale metabolic models (GEM). The approach minimizes uncertainties in enzymatic thermal parameters and greatly improves the predictive strength of the GEMs. The resulting temperature constrained yeast GEM uncovers enzymes that limit growth at superoptimal temperatures, and squalene epoxidase (ERG1) is predicted to be the most rate limiting. By replacing this single key enzyme with an ortholog from a thermotolerant yeast strain, we obtain a thermotolerant strain that outgrows the wild type, demonstrating the critical role of sterol metabolism in yeast thermosensitivity. Therefore, apart from identifying thermal determinants of cell metabolism and enabling the design of thermotolerant strains, our Bayesian GEM approach facilitates modelling of complex biological systems in the absence of high-quality data and therefore shows promise for becoming a standard tool for genome scale modeling.},

DLKcat can capture kcat changes for mutated enzymes and identify amino acid residues with a strong impact on kcat values. We applied this approach to predict genome-scale kcat values for more than 300 yeast species. Additionally, we designed a Bayesian pipeline to parameterize enzyme-constrained genome-scale metabolic models from predicted kcat values. The resulting models outperformed the corresponding original enzyme-constrained genome-scale metabolic models from previous pipelines in predicting phenotypes and proteomes, and enabled us to explain phenotypic differences. DLKcat and the enzyme-constrained genome-scale metabolic model construction pipeline are valuable tools to uncover global trends of enzyme kinetics and physiological diversity, and to further elucidate cellular metabolism on a large scale.},

  abstract = {The study of metagenomics has been much benefited from low-cost and high-throughput sequencing technologies, yet the tremendous amount of data generated make analysis like de novo assembly to consume too much computational resources. In late 2014 we released MEGAHIT v0.1 (together with a brief note of Li et al. (2015) [1]), which is the first NGS metagenome assembler that can assemble genome sequences from metagenomic datasets of hundreds of Giga base-pairs (bp) in a time- and memory-efficient manner on a single server. The core of MEGAHIT is an efficient parallel algorithm for constructing succinct de Bruijn Graphs (SdBG), implemented on a graphical processing unit (GPU). The software has been well received by the assembly community, and there is interest in how to adapt the algorithms to integrate popular assembly practices so as to improve the assembly quality, as well as how to speed up the software using better CPU-based algorithms (instead of GPU). In this paper we first describe the details of the core algorithms in MEGAHIT v0.1, and then we show the new modules to upgrade MEGAHIT to version v1.0, which gives better assembly quality, runs faster and uses less memory. For the Iowa Prairie Soil dataset (252Gbp after quality trimming), the assembly quality of MEGAHIT v1.0, when compared with v0.1, has a significant improvement, namely, 36\% increase in assembly size and 23\% in N50. More interestingly, MEGAHIT v1.0 is no slower than before (even running with the extra modules). This is primarily due to a new CPU-based algorithm for SdBG construction that is faster and requires less memory. Using CPU only, MEGAHIT v1.0 can assemble the Iowa Prairie Soil sample in about 43h, reducing the running time of v0.1 by at least 25\% and memory usage by up to 50\%. MEGAHIT v1.0, exhibiting a smaller memory footprint, can process even larger datasets. The Kansas Prairie Soil sample (484Gbp), the largest publicly available dataset, can now be assembled using no more than 500GB of memory in 7.5days. The assemblies of these datasets (and other large metgenomic datasets), as well as the software, are available at the website https://hku-bal.github.io/megabox.},

  abstract = {Longitudinal sampling of the stool has yielded important insights into the ecological dynamics of the human gut microbiome. However, human stool samples are available approximately once per day, while commensal population doubling times are likely on the order of minutes-to-hours. Despite this mismatch in timescales, much of the prior work on human gut microbiome time series modeling has assumed that day-to-day fluctuations in taxon abundances are related to population growth or death rates, which is likely not the case. Here, we propose an alternative model of the human gut as a stationary system, where population dynamics occur internally and the bacterial population sizes measured in a bolus of stool represent a steady-state endpoint of these dynamics. We formalize this idea as stochastic logistic growth. We show how this model provides a path toward estimating the growth phases of gut bacterial populations in situ. We validate our model predictions using an in vitro Escherichia coli growth experiment. Finally, we show how this method can be applied to densely-sampled human stool metagenomic time series data. We discuss how these growth phase estimates may be used to better inform metabolic modeling in flow-through ecosystems, like animal guts or industrial bioreactors.},

Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are complex diseases that are heterogeneous at the clinical, immunological, molecular, genetic, and microbial levels. Individual contributing factors have been the focus of extensive research. As part of the Integrative Human Microbiome Project (HMP2 or iHMP), we followed 132 subjects for one year each to generate integrated longitudinal molecular profiles of host and microbial activity during disease (up to 24 time points each; in total 2,965 stool, biopsy, and blood specimens). Here we present the results, which provide a comprehensive view of functional dysbiosis in the gut microbiome during inflammatory bowel disease activity. We demonstrate a characteristic increase in facultative anaerobes at the expense of obligate anaerobes, as well as molecular disruptions in microbial transcription (for example, among clostridia), metabolite pools (acylcarnitines, bile acids, and short-chain fatty acids), and levels of antibodies in host serum. Periods of disease activity were also marked by increases in temporal variability, with characteristic taxonomic, functional, and biochemical shifts. Finally, integrative analysis identified microbial, biochemical, and host factors central to this dysregulation. The study's infrastructure resources, results, and data, which are available through the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Multi'omics Database (http://ibdmdb.org), provide the most comprehensive description to date of host and microbial activities in inflammatory bowel diseases.},

  abstract = {Genome-scale models of metabolism and macromolecular expression (ME-models) explicitly compute the optimal proteome composition of a growing cell. ME-models expand upon the well-established genome-scale models of metabolism (M-models), and they enable a new fundamental understanding of cellular growth. ME-models have increased predictive capabilities and accuracy due to their inclusion of the biosynthetic costs for the machinery of life, but they come with a significant increase in model size and complexity. This challenge results in models which are both difficult to compute and challenging to understand conceptually. As a result, ME-models exist for only two organisms (Escherichia coli and Thermotoga maritima) and are still used by relatively few researchers. To address these challenges, we have developed a new software framework called COBRAme for building and simulating ME-models. It is coded in Python and built on COBRApy, a popular platform for using M-models. COBRAme streamlines computation and analysis of ME-models. It provides tools to simplify constructing and editing ME-models to enable ME-model reconstructions for new organisms. We used COBRAme to reconstruct a condensed E. coli ME-model called iJL1678b-ME. This reformulated model gives functionally identical solutions to previous E. coli ME-models while using 1/6 the number of free variables and solving in less than 10 minutes, a marked improvement over the 6 hour solve time of previous ME-model formulations. Errors in previous ME-models were also corrected leading to 52 additional genes that must be expressed in iJL1678b-ME to grow aerobically in glucose minimal in silico media. This manuscript outlines the architecture of COBRAme and demonstrates how ME-models can be created, modified, and shared most efficiently using the new software framework.},

FBA has been successfully used to gain insight in a wide range of applications, such as range of substrate utilization, product yields and to design metabolic engineering strategies to improve bioprocess performance. A well-known challenge associated with large genome-scale metabolic networks is that they result in underdetermined problem formulations. Consequently, rather than unique solutions, FBA and related methods examine ranges of reaction flux values that are consistent with the studied physiological conditions. The wider the reported flux ranges, the higher the uncertainty in the determination of basic reaction properties, limiting interpretability of and confidence in the results. Herein, we propose a new, computationally efficient approach that refines flux range predictions by constraining reaction fluxes on the basis of the elemental balance of carbon. We compared carbon constraint FBA (ccFBA) against experimentally-measured intracellular fluxes using the latest CHO GEM (iCHO1766) and were able to substantially improve the accuracy of predicted flux values compared with FBA. ccFBA can be used as a stand-alone method but is also compatible with and complimentary to other constraint-based approaches.},

  abstract = {Genome-scale metabolic models are instrumental in uncovering operating principles of cellular metabolism, for model-guided re-engineering, and unraveling cross-feeding in microbial communities. Yet, the application of genome-scale models, especially to microbial communities, is lagging behind the availability of sequenced genomes. This is largely due to the time-consuming steps of manual curation required to obtain good quality models. Here, we present an automated tool, CarveMe, for reconstruction of species and community level metabolic models. We introduce the concept of a universal model, which is manually curated and simulation ready. Starting with this universal model and annotated genome sequences, CarveMe uses a top-down approach to build single-species and community models in a fast and scalable manner. We show that CarveMe models perform closely to manually curated models in reproducing experimental phenotypes (substrate utilization and gene essentiality). Additionally, we build a collection of 74 models for human gut bacteria and test their ability to reproduce growth on a set of experimentally defined media. Finally, we create a database of 5587 bacterial models and demonstrate its potential for fast generation of microbial community models. Overall, CarveMe provides an open-source and user-friendly tool towards broadening the use of metabolic modeling in studying microbial species and communities.},

  abstract = {Resource competition and metabolic cross-feeding are among the main drivers of microbial community assembly. Yet the degree to which these two conflicting forces are reflected in the composition of natural communities has not been systematically investigated. Here, we use genome-scale metabolic modelling to assess the potential for resource competition and metabolic cooperation in large co-occurring groups (up to 40 members) across thousands of habitats. Our analysis reveals two distinct community types, which are clustered at opposite ends of a spectrum in a trade-off between competition and cooperation. At one end are highly cooperative communities, characterized by smaller genomes and multiple auxotrophies. At the other end are highly competitive communities, which feature larger genomes and overlapping nutritional requirements, and harbour more genes related to antimicrobial activity. The latter are mainly present in soils, whereas the former are found in both free-living and host-associated habitats. Community-scale flux simulations show that, whereas competitive communities can better resist species invasion but not nutrient shift, cooperative communities are susceptible to species invasion but resilient to nutrient change. We also show, by analysing an additional data set, that colonization by probiotic species is positively associated with the presence of cooperative species in the recipient microbiome. Together, our results highlight the bifurcation between competitive and cooperative metabolism in the assembly of natural communities and its implications for community modulation.},

Construction of genome-scale metabolic models from metagenome-assembled genomes (MAG) has enabled prediction of metabolite production by microbial communities, yet little is known about their accuracy. Here, we examined the performance of two approaches for metabolite prediction from metagenomes, one that is MAG-guided and another that is taxonomic reference-guided. We applied both on shotgun metagenomics data from human and environmental samples, and validated findings in the human samples using untargeted metabolomics. We found that in human samples, where taxonomic profiling is optimized and reference genomes are readily available, when number of input taxa was normalized, the reference-guided approach predicted more metabolites than the MAG-guided approach. The two approaches showed significant overlap but each identified metabolites not predicted in the other. Pathway enrichment analyses identified significant differences in inferences derived from data based on the approach, highlighting the need for caution in interpretation. In environmental samples, when the number of input taxa was normalized, the reference-guided approach predicted more metabolites than the MAG-guided approach for total metabolites in both sample types and non-redundant metabolites in seawater samples. Nonetheless, as was observed for the human samples, the approaches overlapped substantially but also predicted metabolites not observed in the other. Our findings report on utility of a complementary input to genome-scale metabolic model construction that is less computationally intensive forgoing MAG assembly and refinement, and that can be applied on shallow shotgun sequencing where MAGs cannot be generated.},

However, the lack of other constraints in the stoichiometric model often leads to a large metabolic solution space being inaccessible. Inspired by previous studies that take an allocation of macromolecule resources into account, we developed a simplified Python-based workflow for constructing enzymatic constrained metabolic network model (ECMpy) and constructed an enzyme-constrained model for Escherichia coli (eciML1515) by directly adding a total enzyme amount constraint in the latest version of GEM for E. coli (iML1515), considering the protein subunit composition in the reaction, and automated calibration of enzyme kinetic parameters. Using eciML1515, we predicted the overflow metabolism of E. coli and revealed that redox balance was the key reason for the difference between E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae in overflow metabolism. The growth rate predictions on 24 single-carbon sources were improved significantly when compared with other enzyme-constrained models of E. coli. Finally, we revealed the tradeoff between enzyme usage efficiency and biomass yield by exploring the metabolic behaviours under different substrate consumption rates. Enzyme-constrained models can improve simulation accuracy and thus can predict cellular phenotypes under various genetic perturbations more precisely, providing reliable guidance for metabolic engineering.},

Using metabolic models of prokaryotic metagenome-assembled genomes from over 1600 individuals, MES allows us to identify and rank metabolic interactions that are significantly affected by a loss of cross-feeding partners in 10 out of 11 diseases. When applied to a Crohn's disease case-control study, our approach identifies a lack of species with the ability to consume hydrogen sulfide as the main distinguishing microbiome feature of disease.

These networks are often very large and  complex. To properly understand and analyze the global properties of  metabolic networks, methods for rationally representing and quantitatively analyzing their structure are needed.Results:   In this work, the metabolic networks of 80 fully sequenced organisms are in silico reconstructed from genome data and an extensively revised  bioreaction database. The networks are represented as directed graphs and  analyzed by using the` breadth first searching algorithm to identify the  shortest pathway (path length) between any pair of the metabolites. The average path length of the networks are then calculated and compared for all  the organisms. Different from previous studies the connections through  current metabolites and cofactors are deleted to make the path length  analysis physiologically more meaningful. The distribution of the connection  degree of these networks is shown to follow the power law, indicating that  the overall structure of all the metabolic networks has the characteristics  of a small world network. However, clear differences exist in the network  structure of the three domains of organisms. Eukaryotes and archaea have a  longer average path length than bacteria.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several genome-scale metabolic reconstruction software platforms have been developed and are being continuously updated. These tools have been widely applied to reconstruct metabolic models for hundreds of microorganisms ranging from important human pathogens to species of industrial relevance. However, these platforms, as yet, have not been systematically evaluated with respect to software quality, best potential uses and intrinsic capacity to generate high-quality, genome-scale metabolic models. It is therefore unclear for potential users which tool best fits the purpose of their research. RESULTS: In this work, we perform a systematic assessment of current genome-scale reconstruction software platforms. To meet our goal, we first define a list of features for assessing software quality related to genome-scale reconstruction. Subsequently, we use the feature list to evaluate the performance of each tool. To assess the similarity of the draft reconstructions to high-quality models, we compare each tool's output networks with that of the high-quality, manually curated, models of Lactobacillus plantarum and Bordetella pertussis, representatives of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respectively. We additionally compare draft reconstructions with a model of Pseudomonas putida to further confirm our findings. We show that none of the tools outperforms the others in all the defined features. CONCLUSIONS: Model builders should carefully choose a tool (or combinations of tools) depending on the intended use of the metabolic model. They can use this benchmark study as a guide to select the best tool for their research. Finally, developers can also benefit from this evaluation by getting feedback to improve their software.},

  abstract = {Recent success in metabolite identification from tandem mass spectra has been led by machine learning, which has two stages: mapping mass spectra to molecular fingerprint vectors and then retrieving candidate molecules from the database. In the first stage, i.e. fingerprint prediction, spectrum peaks are features and considering their interactions would be reasonable for more accurate identification of unknown metabolites. Existing approaches of fingerprint prediction are based on only individual peaks in the spectra, without explicitly considering the peak interactions. Also the current cutting-edge method is based on kernels, which are computationally heavy and difficult to interpret.We propose two learning models that allow to incorporate peak interactions for fingerprint prediction. First, we extend the state-of-the-art kernel learning method by developing kernels for peak interactions to combine with kernels for peaks through multiple kernel learning (MKL). Second, we formulate a sparse interaction model for metabolite peaks, which we call SIMPLE, which is computationally light and interpretable for fingerprint prediction. The formulation of SIMPLE is convex and guarantees global optimization, for which we develop an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. Experiments using the MassBank dataset show that both models achieved comparative prediction accuracy with the current top-performance kernel method. Furthermore SIMPLE clearly revealed individual peaks and peak interactions which contribute to enhancing the performance of fingerprint prediction.The code will be accessed through http://mamitsukalab.org/tools/SIMPLE/.},

  abstract = {The genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) is a powerful tool for interpreting and predicting cellular phenotypes under various environmental and genetic perturbations. However, GEM only considers stoichiometric constraints, and the simulated growth and product yield values will show a monotonic linear increase with increasing substrate uptake rate, which deviates from the experimentally measured values. Recently, the integration of enzymatic constraints into stoichiometry-based GEMs was proven to be effective in making novel discoveries and predicting new engineering targets. Here, we present the first genome-scale enzyme-constrained model (ecCGL1) for Corynebacterium glutamicum reconstructed by integrating enzyme kinetic data from various sources using a ECMpy workflow based on the high-quality GEM of C. glutamicum (obtained by modifying the iCW773 model). The enzyme-constrained model improved the prediction of phenotypes and simulated overflow metabolism, while also recapitulating the trade-off between biomass yield and enzyme usage efficiency. Finally, we used the ecCGL1 to identify several gene modification targets for l-lysine production, most of which agree with previously reported genes. This study shows that incorporating enzyme kinetic information into the GEM enhances the cellular phenotypes prediction of C. glutamicum, which can help identify key enzymes and thus provide reliable guidance for metabolic engineering.},

As these interactions often involve a fitness cost, it is unclear how stable cooperation can emerge. Here we use genome-scale metabolic models to investigate whether the release of "costless" metabolites (i.e. those that cause no fitness cost to the producer), can be a prominent driver of intermicrobial interactions. By performing over 2 million pairwise growth simulations of 24 species in a combinatorial assortment of environments, we identify a large space of metabolites that can be secreted without cost, thus generating ample cross-feeding opportunities. In addition to providing an atlas of putative interactions, we show that anoxic conditions can promote mutualisms by providing more opportunities for exchange of costless metabolites, resulting in an overrepresentation of stable ecological network motifs. These results may help identify interaction patterns in natural communities and inform the design of synthetic microbial consortia.},

  abstract = {A large number of genome-scale models of cellular metabolism are available for various organisms. These models include all known metabolic reactions based on the genome annotation. However, the reactions that are active are dependent on the cellular metabolic function or environmental condition. Constraint-based methods that integrate condition-specific transcriptomics data into models have been used extensively to investigate condition-specific metabolism. Here, we present a method (TEX-FBA) for modeling condition-specific metabolism that combines transcriptomics and reaction thermodynamics data to generate a thermodynamically-feasible condition-specific metabolic model. TEX-FBA is an extension of thermodynamic-based flux balance analysis (TFA), which allows the simultaneous integration of different stages of experimental data (e.g., absolute gene expression, metabolite concentrations, thermodynamic data, and fluxomics) and the identification of alternative metabolic states that maximize consistency between gene expression levels and condition-specific reaction fluxes. We applied TEX-FBA to a genome-scale metabolic model of Escherichia coli by integrating available condition-specific experimental data and found a marked reduction in the flux solution space. Our analysis revealed a marked correlation between actual gene expression profile and experimental flux measurements compared to the one obtained from a randomly generated gene expression profile. We identified additional essential reactions from the membrane lipid and folate metabolism when we integrated transcriptomics data of the given condition on the top of metabolomics and thermodynamics data. These results show TEX-FBA is a promising new approach to study condition-specific metabolism when different types of experimental data are available. Author summary Cells utilize nutrients via biochemical reactions that are controlled by enzymes and synthesize required compounds for their survival and growth. Genome-scale models of metabolism representing these complex reaction networks have been reconstructed for a wide variety of organisms ranging from bacteria to human cells. These models comprise all possible biochemical reactions in a cell, but cells choose only a subset of reactions for their immediate needs and functions. Usually, these models allow for a large flux solution space and one can integrate experimental data in order to reduce it and potentially predict the physiology for a specific condition. We developed a method for integrating different types of omics data, such as fluxomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics into genome-scale metabolic models that reduces the flux solution space. Using gene expression data, the algorithm maximizes the consistency between the predicted and experimental flux for the reactions and predicts biologically relevant flux ranges for the remaining reactions in the network. This method is useful for determining fluxes of metabolic reactions with reduced uncertainty and suitable for performing context- and condition-specific analysis in metabolic models using different types of experimental data.},

However, the production of SCFAs can vary widely between individuals consuming the same diet, with lower levels often associated with disease. A systems-scale mechanistic understanding of this heterogeneity is lacking. Here we use a microbial community-scale metabolic modelling (MCMM) approach to predict individual-specific SCFA production profiles to assess the impact of different dietary, prebiotic and probiotic inputs. We evaluate the quantitative accuracy of our MCMMs using in vitro and ex vivo data, plus published human cohort data. We find that MCMM SCFA predictions are significantly associated with blood-derived clinical chemistries, including cardiometabolic and immunological health markers, across a large human cohort. Finally, we demonstrate how MCMMs can be leveraged to design personalized dietary, prebiotic and probiotic interventions aimed at optimizing SCFA production in the gut. Our model represents an approach to direct gut microbiome engineering for precision health and nutrition.},

Several EC number prediction tools are currently available, but their prediction performance needs to be further improved to precisely and efficiently process an ever-increasing volume of protein sequence data. Here, we report DeepEC, a deep learning-based computational framework that predicts EC numbers for protein sequences with high precision and in a high-throughput manner. DeepEC takes a protein sequence as input and predicts EC numbers as output. DeepEC uses 3 convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as a major engine for the prediction of EC numbers, and also implements homology analysis for EC numbers that cannot be classified by the CNNs. Comparative analyses against 5 representative EC number prediction tools show that DeepEC allows the most precise prediction of EC numbers, and is the fastest and the lightest in terms of the disk space required. Furthermore, DeepEC is the most sensitive in detecting the effects of mutated domains/binding site residues of protein sequences. DeepEC can be used as an independent tool, and also as a third-party software component in combination with other computational platforms that examine metabolic reactions.},

  abstract = {The availability of multi-omics data sets and genome-scale metabolic models for various organisms provide a platform for modeling and analyzing genotype-to-phenotype relationships. Flux balance analysis is the main tool for predicting flux distributions in genome-scale metabolic models and various data-integrative approaches enable modeling context-specific network behavior. Due to its linear nature, this optimization framework is readily scalable to multi-tissue or -organ and even multi-organism models. However, both data and model size can hamper a straightforward biological interpretation of the estimated fluxes. Moreover, flux balance analysis simulates metabolism at steady-state and thus, in its most basic form, does not consider kinetics or regulatory events. The integration of flux balance analysis with complementary data analysis and modeling techniques offers the potential to overcome these challenges. In particular machine learning approaches have emerged as the tool of choice for data reduction and selection of most important variables in big data sets. Kinetic models and formal languages can be used to simulate dynamic behavior. This review article provides an overview of integrative studies that combine flux balance analysis with machine learning approaches, kinetic models, such as physiology-based pharmacokinetic models, and formal graphical modeling languages, such as Petri nets. We discuss the mathematical aspects and biological applications of these integrated approaches and outline challenges and future perspectives.},

  abstract = {Vitis vinifera, also known as grapevine, is widely cultivated and commercialized, particularly to produce wine. As wine quality is directly linked to fruit quality, studying grapevine metabolism is important to understand the processes underlying grape composition. Genome-scale metabolic models (GSMMs) have been used for the study of plant metabolism and advances have been made, allowing the integration of omics datasets with GSMMs. On the other hand, Machine learning (ML) has been used to analyze and integrate omics data, and while the combination of ML with GSMMs has shown promising results, it is still scarcely used to study plants. Here, the first GSSM of V. vinifera was reconstructed and validated, comprising 7199 genes, 5399 reactions, and 5141 metabolites across 8 compartments. Tissue-specific models for the stem, leaf, and berry of the Cabernet Sauvignon cultivar were generated from the original model, through the integration of RNA-Seq data. These models have been merged into diel multi-tissue models to study the interactions between tissues at light and dark phases. The potential of combining ML with GSMMs was explored by using ML to analyze the fluxomics data generated by green and mature grape GSMMs and provide insights regarding the metabolism of grapes at different developmental stages. Therefore, the models developed in this work are useful tools to explore different aspects of grapevine metabolism and understand the factors influencing grape quality.},

AMPSphere provides insights into the evolutionary origins of peptides, including by duplication or gene truncation of longer sequences, and we observed that AMP production varies by habitat. To validate our predictions, we synthesized and tested 100 AMPs against clinically relevant drug-resistant pathogens and human gut commensals both in vitro and in vivo. A total of 79 peptides were active, with 63 targeting pathogens. These active AMPs exhibited antibacterial activity by disrupting bacterial membranes. In conclusion, our approach identified nearly one million prokaryotic AMP sequences, an open-access resource for antibiotic discovery.},

GSMM can, for example, be applied to estimate the metabolic capabilities of microbes in the gut.

We studied how human gut bacteria influence colonization of two major bacterial pathogens, both in vitro and in gnotobiotic mice. Whereas single species alone had negligible effects, colonization resistance greatly increased with community diversity. Moreover, this community-level resistance rested critically upon certain species being present. We explained these ecological patterns through the collective ability of resistant communities to consume nutrients that overlap with those used by the pathogen. Furthermore, we applied our findings to successfully predict communities that resist a novel target strain. Our work provides a reason why microbiome diversity is beneficial and suggests a route for the rational design of pathogen-resistant communities.},

  abstract = {Maintaining metal homeostasis is crucial for the adaptation of Helicobacter pylori to the gastric environment. Iron, copper, and nickel homeostasis has recently been demonstrated to be required for the establishment of H. pylori infection in animal models. Here we demonstrate that the HP0969-0971 gene cluster encoding the Czc-type metal export pump homologs HP0969, HP0970, and the H. pylori-specific protein HP0971 forms part of a novel H. pylori metal resistance determinant, which is required for gastric colonization and for the modulation of urease activity. Insertional mutagenesis of the HP0971, HP0970, or HP0969 genes in H. pylori reference strain 26695 resulted in increased sensitivity to cadmium, zinc, and nickel (czn), suggesting that the encoded proteins constitute a metal-specific export pump. Accordingly, the genes were designated cznC (HP0971), cznB (HP0970), and cznA (HP0969). The CznC and CznA proteins play a predominant role in nickel homeostasis, since only the cznC and cznA mutants but not the cznB mutant displayed an 8- to 10-fold increase in urease activity. Nickel-specific affinity chromatography demonstrated that recombinant versions of CznC and CznB can bind to nickel and that the purified CznB protein interacted with cadmium and zinc, since both metals competitively inhibited nickel binding. Finally, single cznA, cznB, and cznC mutants did not colonize the stomach in a Mongolian gerbil-based animal model. This demonstrates that the metal export functions of H. pylori cznABC are essential for gastric colonization and underlines the extraordinary importance of metal ion homeostasis for the survival of H. pylori in the gastric environment.},

Engineered microbial communities are also extremely relevant to tackling some of today's grand societal challenges. Advanced meta-omics experimental techniques provide crucial insights into microbial communities, but have been so far mostly used for descriptive, exploratory approaches to answer the initial 'who is there?' QUESTION: An ecosystem is a complex network of dynamic spatio-temporal interactions among organisms as well as between organisms and the environment. Mathematical models with their abstraction capability are essential to capture the underlying phenomena and connect the different scales at which these systems act. Differential equation models and constraint-based stoichiometric models are deterministic approaches that can successfully provide a macroscopic description of the outcome from microscopic behaviors. In this mini-review, we present classical and recent applications of these modeling methods and illustrate the potential of their integration. Indeed, approaches that can capture multiple scales are needed in order to understand emergent patterns in ecosystems and their dynamics regulated by different spatio-temporal phenomena. We finally discuss promising examples of methods proposing the integration of differential equations with constraint-based stoichiometric models and argue that more work is needed in this direction.},

  abstract = {Comprehensive molecular-level models of human metabolism have been generated on a cellular level. However, models of whole-body metabolism have not been established as they require new methodological approaches to integrate molecular and physiological data. We developed a new metabolic network reconstruction approach that used organ-specific information from literature and omics data to generate two sex-specific whole-body metabolic (WBM) reconstructions. These reconstructions capture the metabolism of 26 organs and six blood cell types. Each WBM reconstruction represents whole-body organ-resolved metabolism with over 80,000 biochemical reactions in an anatomically and physiologically consistent manner. We parameterized the WBM reconstructions with physiological, dietary, and metabolomic data. The resulting WBM models could recapitulate known inter-organ metabolic cycles and energy use. We also illustrate that the WBM models can predict known biomarkers of inherited metabolic diseases in different biofluids. Predictions of basal metabolic rates, by WBM models personalized with physiological data, outperformed current phenomenological models. Finally, integrating microbiome data allowed the exploration of host-microbiome co-metabolism. Overall, the WBM reconstructions, and their derived computational models, represent an important step toward virtual physiological humans.},

These reconstructions represent structured knowledge bases that abstract pertinent information on the biochemical transformations taking place within specific target organisms. The conversion of a reconstruction into a mathematical format facilitates a myriad of computational biological studies, including evaluation of network content, hypothesis testing and generation, analysis of phenotypic characteristics and metabolic engineering. To date, genome-scale metabolic reconstructions for more than 30 organisms have been published and this number is expected to increase rapidly. However, these reconstructions differ in quality and coverage that may minimize their predictive potential and use as knowledge bases. Here we present a comprehensive protocol describing each step necessary to build a high-quality genome-scale metabolic reconstruction, as well as the common trials and tribulations. Therefore, this protocol provides a helpful manual for all stages of the reconstruction process.},

We adopted metagenome-informed metaproteomics (MIM), in mice and humans, to non-invasively explore species-level microbiome-host interactions during commensal and pathogen colonization, nutritional modification, and antibiotic-induced perturbation. Simultaneously, fecal MIM accurately characterized the nutritional exposure landscape in multiple clinical and dietary contexts. Implementation of MIM in murine auto-inflammation and in human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) characterized a "compositional dysbiosis" and a concomitant species-specific "functional dysbiosis" driven by suppressed commensal responses to inflammatory host signals. Microbiome transfers unraveled early-onset kinetics of these host-commensal cross-responsive patterns, while predictive analyses identified candidate fecal host-microbiome IBD biomarker protein pairs outperforming S100A8/S100A9 (calprotectin). Importantly, a simultaneous fecal nutritional MIM assessment enabled the determination of IBD-related consumption patterns, dietary treatment compliance, and small intestinal digestive aberrations. Collectively, a parallelized dietary-bacterial-host MIM assessment functionally uncovers trans-kingdom interactomes shaping gastrointestinal ecology while offering personalized diagnostic and therapeutic insights into microbiome-associated disease.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The human microbiome is an integral component of the human body and a co-determinant of several health conditions1,2. However, the extent to which interpersonal relations shape the individual genetic makeup of the microbiome and its transmission within and across populations remains largely unknown3,4. Here, capitalizing on more than 9,700 human metagenomes and computational strain-level profiling, we detected extensive bacterial strain sharing across individuals (more than 10 million instances) with distinct mother-to-infant, intra-household and intra-population transmission patterns. Mother-to-infant gut microbiome transmission was considerable and stable during infancy (around 50\% of the same strains among shared species (strain-sharing rate)) and remained detectable at older ages. By contrast, the transmission of the oral microbiome occurred largely horizontally and was enhanced by the duration of cohabitation. There was substantial strain sharing among cohabiting individuals, with 12\% and 32\% median strain-sharing rates for the gut and oral microbiomes, and time since cohabitation affected strain sharing more than age or genetics~did. Bacterial strain sharing additionally recapitulated host population structures better than species-level profiles~did. Finally, distinct taxa appeared as efficient spreaders across transmission modes and were associated with different predicted bacterial phenotypes linked with out-of-host survival capabilities. The extent of microorganism transmission that we describe underscores its relevance in human microbiome studies5, especially those on non-infectious, microbiome-associated diseases.},

Emergent properties - patterns or functions that cannot be deduced linearly from the properties of the constituent parts - underlie important ecological characteristics such as resilience, niche expansion, and spatial self-organisation. While it is clear that emergent properties are a consequence of interactions within the community, their non-linear nature makes mathematical modelling imperative for establishing the quantitative link between community structure and function. As the need for conservation and rational modulation of microbial ecosystems is increasingly apparent, so is the consideration of the benefits and limitations of the approaches to model emergent properties. Here we review ecosystem modelling approaches from the viewpoint of emergent properties. We consider the scope, advantages, and limitations of Lotka-Volterra, consumer-resource, trait-based, individual-based, and genome-scale metabolic models. Future efforts in this research area would benefit from capitalising on the complementarity between these approaches towards enabling rational modulation of complex microbial ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Gut microbes play prime role in human health and have shown to exert their influence on various physiological responses including neurological functions. Growing evidences in recent years have indicated a key role of gut microbiota in contributing to mental health. The connection between gut and brain is modulated by microbes via neural, neuroendocrinal and metabolic pathways that are mediated through various neurotransmitters and their precursors, hormones, cytokines and bioactive metabolites. Impaired functioning of this connection can lead to manifestation of mental disorders. Around 1 billion of the world population is reported to suffer from emotional, psychological and neurological imbalances, substance use disorders and cognitive, psychosocial and intellectual disabilities. Thus, it becomes imperative to understand the role of gut microbes in mental disorders. Since variations occur in the conditions associated with different mental disorders and some of them have overlapping symptoms, it becomes important to have a holistic understanding of gut dysbiosis in these disorders. In this review, we consolidate the recent data on alterations in the gut microbes and its consequences in various neurological, psychological and neurodegenerative disorders. Further, considering these evidences, several studies have been undertaken to specifically target the gut microbiota through different therapeutic interventions including administration of live microbes (psychobiotics) to treat mental health disorders and/or their symptoms. We review these studies and propose that an integrative and personalized approach, where combinations of microbe-based therapeutic interventions to modulate gut microbes and in-use psychological treatment practices can be integrated and based on patient's gut microbiome can be potentially adopted for effective treatment of the mental disorders.},

Therefore, deactivating antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and removing antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) from water is crucial for controlling AMR transmission. Peracetic acid (PAA), which is known for its potent oxidizing properties and limited by-product formation, is emerging as a favorable disinfectant for water treatment. In this study, we aimed to assess the efficacy of pre-exposure to PAA followed by UV treatment (PAA-UV/PAA) compared with the simultaneous application of UV and PAA (UV/PAA). The focus was on deactivating vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VREfs), a typical ARB in water. Pre-exposure to PAA significantly enhanced the efficacy of subsequent UV/PAA treatment. At a UV fluence of 7.2~mJ~cm-2, the PAA-UV/PAA method achieved a 6.21 log reduction in VREfs, surpassing the 1.29 log reduction observed with UV/PAA. Moreover, compared to UV/PAA, PAA-UV/PAA showed increased efficacy with longer pre-exposure times and higher PAA concentrations, maintaining superior performance across a broad pH range and in the presence of humic acid. Flow cytometry analysis indicated minimal cellular membrane damage using both methods. However, the assessments of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and adenosine triphosphate content revealed that PAA-UV/PAA induced greater oxidative stress under similar UV irradiation conditions, leading to slower bacterial regrowth. Specifically, SOD activity in PAA-UV/PAA surged to 3.06 times its baseline, exceeding the 1.73-fold increase under UV/PAA conditions. Additionally, pre-exposure to PAA amplified ARGs degradation and reduced resistance gene leakage, effectively mitigating the spread of AMR. Pre-exposure to 200~{$\mu$}M PAA for 10 and 20~min enhanced vanB gene removal efficiency by 0.14 log and 1.29 log, respectively. Our study provides a feasible approach for optimizing UV/PAA disinfection for efficient removal of ARB and ARGs.},

We used a comprehensive dataset of more than 5000 prokaryotic species from which we derived the metabolic networks. We compute the scope from the reconstructed graphs, which is the set of all metabolites and reactions that can potentially be synthesized when provided with external metabolites. We show using machine learning techniques that the scope is an excellent predictor of taxonomic and environmental variables, namely growth temperature, oxygen tolerance, and habitat. In the literature, metabolites and pathways are rarely used to discriminate species. We make use of the scope underlying structure-metabolites and pathways-to construct the predictive models, giving additional information on the important metabolic pathways needed to discriminate the species, which is often absent in other metabolic network properties. For example, in the particular case of growth temperature, glutathione biosynthesis pathways are specific to species growing in cold environments, whereas tungsten metabolism is specific to species in warm environments, as was hinted in current literature. From a machine learning perspective, the scope is able to reduce the dimension of our data, and can thus be considered as an interpretable graph embedding.},

  abstract = {Genetic algorithms are a robust adaptive optimization method based on biological principles. A population of strings representing possible problem solutions is maintained. Search proceeds by recombining strings in the population. The theoretical foundations of genetic algorithms are based on the notion that selective reproduction and recombination of binary strings changes the sampling rate of hyperplanes in the search space so as to reflect the average fitness of strings that reside in any particular hyperplane. Thus, genetic algorithms need not search along the contours of the function being optimized and tend not to become trapped in local minima. This paper is an overview of several different experiments applying genetic algorithms to neural network problems. These problems include 1.(1) optimizing the weighted connections in feed-forward neural networks using both binary and real-valued representations, and2.(2) using a genetic algorithm to discover novel architectures in the form of connectivity patterns for neural networks that learn using error propagation. Future applications in neural network optimization in which genetic algorithm can perhaps play a significant role are also presented.},

Here we demonstrate that, starting in mid-to-late adulthood, gut microbiomes become increasingly unique to individuals with age. We leverage three independent cohorts comprising over 9000 individuals and find that compositional uniqueness is strongly associated with microbially produced amino acid derivatives circulating in the bloodstream. In older age (over {\textasciitilde}80 years), healthy individuals show continued microbial drift toward a unique compositional state, whereas this drift is absent in less healthy individuals. The identified microbiome pattern of healthy aging is characterized by a depletion of core genera found across most humans, primarily Bacteroides. Retaining a high Bacteroides dominance into older age, or having a low gut microbiome uniqueness measure, predicts decreased survival in a four-year follow-up. Our analysis identifies increasing compositional uniqueness of the gut microbiome as a component of healthy aging, which is characterized by distinct microbial metabolic outputs in the blood.},

  abstract = {PacBio long reads sequencing presents several potential advantages for DNA assembly, including being able to provide more complete gene profiling of metagenomic samples. However, lower single-pass accuracy can make gene discovery and assembly for low-abundance organisms difficult. To evaluate the application and performance of PacBio long reads and Illumina HiSeq short reads in metagenomic analyses, we directly compared various assemblies involving PacBio and Illumina sequencing reads based on two anaerobic digestion microbiome samples from a biogas fermenter. Using a PacBio platform, 1.58 million long reads (19.6 Gb) were produced with an average length of 7,604 bp. Using an Illumina HiSeq platform, 151.2 million read pairs (45.4 Gb) were produced. Hybrid assemblies using PacBio long reads and HiSeq contigs produced improvements in assembly statistics, including an increase in the average contig length, contig N50 size, and number of large contigs. Interestingly, depth-based hybrid assemblies generated a higher percentage of complete genes (98.86\%) compared to those based on HiSeq contigs only (40.29\%), because the PacBio reads were long enough to cover many repeating short elements and capture multiple genes in a single read. Additionally, the incorporation of PacBio long reads led to considerable advantages regarding reducing contig numbers and increasing the completeness of the genome reconstruction, which was poorly assembled and binned when using HiSeq data alone. From this comparison of PacBio long reads with Illumina HiSeq short reads related to complex microbiome samples, we conclude that PacBio long reads can produce longer contigs, more complete genes, and better genome binning, thereby offering more information about metagenomic samples.},

The composition of the community and the interactions between its members affect degradation rate and determine the identity of the final products. Here, we demonstrate the application of sequencing technologies and metabolic modeling approaches towards enhancing biodegradation of atrazine---a herbicide causing environmental pollution. Treatment of agriculture soil with atrazine is shown to induce significant changes in community structure and functional performances. Genome-scale metabolic models were constructed for Arthrobacter, the atrazine degrader, and four other non-atrazine degrading species whose relative abundance in soil was changed following exposure to the herbicide. By modeling community function we show that consortia including the direct degrader and non-degrader differentially abundant species perform better than Arthrobacter alone. Simulations predict that growth/degradation enhancement is derived by metabolic exchanges between community members. Based on simulations we designed endogenous consortia optimized for enhanced degradation whose performances were validated in vitro and biostimulation strategies that were tested in pot experiments. Overall, our analysis demonstrates that understanding community function in its wider context, beyond the single direct degrader perspective, promotes the design of biostimulation strategies.},

The development and application of these methodological frameworks have occurred independently for the most part, whereas the potential of their integration for biological, biomedical, and biotechnological research is less known. Here, we describe how machine learning and constraint-based modeling can be combined, reviewing recent works at the intersection of both domains and discussing the mathematical and practical aspects involved. We overlap systematic classifications from both frameworks, making them accessible to nonexperts. Finally, we delineate potential future scenarios, propose new joint theoretical frameworks, and suggest concrete points of investigation for this joint subfield. A multiview approach merging experimental and knowledge-driven omic data through machine learning methods can incorporate key mechanistic information in an otherwise biologically-agnostic learning process.},

It is unclear, however, how the rise of these interactions varies across metabolites and organisms. Here we address this question by integrating genome-scale models of metabolism with evolutionary game theory. Specifically, we use microbial fitness values estimated by metabolic models to infer evolutionarily stable interactions in multi-species microbial "games". We first validate our approach using a well-characterized yeast cheater-cooperator system. We next perform over 80,000 in silico experiments to infer how metabolic interdependencies mediated by amino acid leakage in Escherichia coli vary across 189 amino acid pairs. While most pairs display shared patterns of inter-species interactions, multiple deviations are caused by pleiotropy and epistasis in metabolism. Furthermore, simulated invasion experiments reveal possible paths to obligate cross-feeding. Our study provides genomically driven insight into the rise of ecological interactions, with implications for microbiome research and synthetic ecology.},

Despite the growing availability of high-throughput sequencing and metagenomic data, we still know very little about the metabolic contributions of individual microbial players within an ecological niche and the extent and directionality of interactions among them. This calls for development of efficient modeling frameworks to shed light on less understood aspects of metabolism in microbial communities. Here, we introduce OptCom, a comprehensive flux balance analysis framework for microbial communities, which relies on a multi-level and multi-objective optimization formulation to properly describe trade-offs between individual vs. community level fitness criteria. In contrast to earlier approaches that rely on a single objective function, here, we consider species-level fitness criteria for the inner problems while relying on community-level objective maximization for the outer problem. OptCom is general enough to capture any type of interactions (positive, negative or combinations thereof) and is capable of accommodating any number of microbial species (or guilds) involved. We applied OptCom to quantify the syntrophic association in a well-characterized two-species microbial system, assess the level of sub-optimal growth in phototrophic microbial mats, and elucidate the extent and direction of inter-species metabolite and electron transfer in a model microbial community. We also used OptCom to examine addition of a new member to an existing community. Our study demonstrates the importance of trade-offs between species- and community-level fitness driving forces and lays the foundation for metabolic-driven analysis of various types of interactions in multi-species microbial systems using genome-scale metabolic models.},
